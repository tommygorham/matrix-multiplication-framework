# matrix-multiplication-framework
Framework for building high-performance matrix-multiplication codes with C++. 

# Directions 
### Until more handling is added for cross-platform tests, the preferred way to build this is with CMake and GCC on Linux 
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc 
make
